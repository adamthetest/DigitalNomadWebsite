## ⚙️ Phase 1 – Infrastructure & Data Setup
**Objective:** Prepare the data and architecture required for AI models and automation.

### 🔧 Tasks
- [ ] Add structured city data: cost, internet speed, weather, safety, visa type.  
- [ ] Add user profile metadata: skills, profession, preferred climates, budgets.  
- [ ] Create internal API endpoints: `/api/v1/cities`, `/api/v1/jobs`, `/api/v1/users`.  
- [ ] Connect data sources (NomadList, Numbeo, VisaHQ, RemoteOK).  
- [ ] Create a central “AI Context” table in your DB:  
  - `context_type`: city, user, job  
  - `context_data`: JSON (key data points for AI models)  
- [ ] Use Laravel queues + cron for daily updates and cleanup.

### 💡 Outcome
Your database becomes **AI-ready** — structured, normalized, and automatically updated.
