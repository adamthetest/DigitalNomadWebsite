# 🤖 Digital Nomad Website — AI & Automation Implementation Plan

## 🧭 Overview
Goal: Build an **AI-powered ecosystem** that enhances discovery, decision-making, and personalization across your website.  
This includes:
- AI assistants for nomads (city and visa advice)
- Smart content and job matching
- Automated newsletters and reports
- Predictive insights for users and admins

---

## ⚙️ Phase 1 – Infrastructure & Data Setup
**Objective:** Prepare the data and architecture required for AI models and automation.

### 🔧 Tasks
- [ ] Add structured city data: cost, internet speed, weather, safety, visa type.  
- [ ] Add user profile metadata: skills, profession, preferred climates, budgets.  
- [ ] Create internal API endpoints: `/api/v1/cities`, `/api/v1/jobs`, `/api/v1/users`.  
- [ ] Connect data sources (NomadList, Numbeo, VisaHQ, RemoteOK).  
- [ ] Create a central “AI Context” table in your DB:  
  - `context_type`: city, user, job  
  - `context_data`: JSON (key data points for AI models)  
- [ ] Use Laravel queues + cron for daily updates and cleanup.

### 💡 Outcome
Your database becomes **AI-ready** — structured, normalized, and automatically updated.

## 🧠 Phase 2 – AI-Powered City Insights
**Objective:** Help users decide where to go and live next with AI recommendations.

### 🧩 Features

  - Response: personalized city list ranked by cost, weather, and visa ease.
- City summaries:
  - Generate with AI (“Bali is ideal for freelancers seeking tropical balance…”)
- City comparison:
  - “Compare Lisbon vs. Medellín” → dynamic AI-generated summary.

### 🔧 Implementation
- [ ] Build `/ai/advisor` endpoint (Laravel controller + OpenAI API).  
- [ ] Store prompts and responses in DB for reuse (caching).  
- [ ] Generate summaries asynchronously via queue worker.  
- [ ] Render on city pages with “AI Insight” widget.

### 💰 Monetization
- Free: basic insights.  
- Premium: advanced “personalized advisor” (AI-driven decision tree).
